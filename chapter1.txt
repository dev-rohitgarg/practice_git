Hello, I am learning Git.

Step1: first run "git init" command to intialize git. My current directory is "Working Directory",
        where we do git init.
Step2: There is somthing called Staging Area. And that is basically an intermediate place 
        where you can pick and choose which files inside your working directory that you want to commit.
        So to see what's currently inside your staging area, you can use the "git status" command, 
        and it shows you that there are untracked files (not in Staging Area) which will be shown in red.
Step3: In order to add it to the staging area and to start tracking changes in it, then we have to use
        the command, "git add <file name>". this is now in the staging area and it's ready to be committed.
        it is now green.
        "git add ." will add all the files to staging area.
Step4: To commit the file in Staging area, Use "git commit -m <message to know the changes in this version>"
        write message in present tense, as it is a good practice.
Step5:  you can see what commits you have made by using the, "git log" command.
