1       How to commit using git.
        Step1:  The first thing is creating a Remote. So it's telling my Local Git Repository that I've created
                a Remote Repository somewhere on the internet and I want to transfer all of my commits over 
                there."git remote add origin main <URL of our remote repository on GitHub>". Here origin is the 
                name of Remote, by convention programmer use origin as remote name.
        Step2:  "git push -u origin main". Here -u is used so that after this command I can ignore writting 
                orgin main again and again in git push or pull commands.
